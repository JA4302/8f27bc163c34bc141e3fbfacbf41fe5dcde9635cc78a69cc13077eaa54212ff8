# Notes
This is a fork of a GBA emu made by someone else so it would have a new url and would not be blocked by content keeper

# Credit
This was originally made by srojam, and forked by jsemu3, and then forked again by me.
It says this repo is mine, but i re made it and uploaded the files, due to the fact that i had one already, but it broke, The old website just redirects to this one's website.
I got a lot of work to do.
